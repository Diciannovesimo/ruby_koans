- DAY 3 15/07/19
after several days trying to study the Ruby logic, I learn how to comment on Ruby (single line, multiple lines), understanding the Ruby variables (type and scope) and Ruby Methods.
the argument which has opened my mind is Ruby Ranges "https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Ranges"
I never see this in no other language.

in the last Koans I see the test test_other_objects_are_not_affected_by_these_singleton_methods
In line 38 I finish first all the Koans except this, then I see the assert_raise deep. I know what assert_raise do "sees if an exception is raised" but I don't know the name of that exceptions so I try different solutions trying to write Exception NullException e. Exception but nothing work so I go on the public repository of this Koans "https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans/blob/master/src/about_class_methods.rb" and see what exception is raised in the next day I want to discover the "exception" on Ruby.

Resolved:
- about_assert.rb (Low)
-about_block.rb (High)
-about_class_method (Medium)
