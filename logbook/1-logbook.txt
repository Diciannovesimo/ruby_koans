-DAY 1: 09/07/19

I read the information on the site "http://rubykoans.com/" and it would seem that the third link no work longer, so I read the documentation on http://beginrescueend.com/
and I download the installer of a command line for ruby called "RubyInstaller for Windows".

I found this last method simpler since the "PIK" project seems to be out of use since 2012.

I download the ruby koans and put it on google drive because I don't wanna wasting time try to remember where I put my files and my USB. 
I'm using sublime text 3 for writing the koans and to execute them I go to the "koans" folder, I press shift + right click and I click "Open PowerShell window here", then from PowerShell, I use the command ruby name_file.rb.

I open a new public repository "https://github.com/Diciannovesimo/Ruby" and start to resolve koans.
below I indicate the koans solved, besides indicating the level of difficulty that I felt by solving them in brackets (low) (medium) (high)

Resolved:
- about_array_assignment.rb (low)
the electric current comes and goes for today I interrupt here.
