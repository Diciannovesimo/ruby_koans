- DAY 4 27/07/19

today I learned a lot about the ruby classes and methods,
I still have to fully understand the ":" and "::" functions
but I realized that the first one serves to "mark" objects 
instead the second one is used to refer to variables that are not local,
depending on where you are in the code, I found the dice koans very funny,
even though I didn't understand it immediately.

Resolved:
-about_classes(medium)
-about_constants(low)
-about_control_statements(low)
-about_dice_project(medium)
