DAY 5 28-29/07/19
in these two days, I focused on these koans, 
finding difficulties in the "scoring project"
 because I realized I was still thinking as if 
I were working with java or c for the other koans 
I found them quite easy and I understood what they 
wanted to say.

I can't get java koans to start, also I didn't 
finish the dice game koans and in "about_methods.rb" 
I skipped a test because I didn't understand it.

Resolved:
about_message_passing.rb(low)
about_keyword_arguments.rb(medium)
about_nil.rb(low)
about_iteration.rb(medium)
about_inheritance.rb(medium)
about_scroing_project.rb(high)
about_hashes.rb(medium)
about_exceptions.rb(high)
