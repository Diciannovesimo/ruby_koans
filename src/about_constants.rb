  # QUESTION: Which has precedence: The constant in the lexical scope,
  # or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?

  # the constant in the lexical scope have takes precedence because
  # MyAnimals::Bird refers to the lexical scope variable Legs = 2 because when you use
  # nameclass::innerclassname ... the lexical scope variable takes precedence infact
  # if you use only Bird and delete class MyAnimals the constant from inheritance hierarchy
  # LEGS = 4 takes the precedence

  # QUESTION: Now which has precedence: The constant in the lexical
  # scope, or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?  Why is it
  # different than the previous answer?
  # 
  # Because in this case we dont declare a class named MyAnimals but 
  # the name of the class is "MyAnimals::Oyster" and this can be misleading
  # but but there is no difference between this class and the one declared in the line
  # 43 named Reptile.
